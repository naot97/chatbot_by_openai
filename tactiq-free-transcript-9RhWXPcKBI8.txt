Title: Survive 100 Days Trapped, Win $500,000

00:00:00.100 I've built a massiveisolation chamber
00:00:03.703 and we're going to seeif these two strangers
00:00:06.072 can survive in this cubefor the next 100 days.
00:00:09.542 They have never met each other ever.
00:00:11.678 Bailey. This is Suzie.
00:00:13.480 Suzie, this is Bailey.- Nice to meet you.
00:00:15.215 Hi! Nice to meet you.
00:00:16.383 If the two of you can survivethe next 100 days in here.
00:00:19.185 I will give you the half a milliondollars inside of this vault.
00:00:22.522 But if one of you leaves before the 100days is up, you both get nothing.
00:00:27.527 All right. I think youguys understand the rules.
00:00:29.662 Have fun.- Okay. Bye.
00:00:32.665 This is going to be crazy.
00:00:39.773 Yeah.
00:00:40.673 This is actually like an insaneasylum.
00:00:43.176 They're currently looking at allthe stuff we put in there.
00:00:45.211 We gave them enough foodfor 100 days,
00:00:46.646 which is healthy,but basically the exact same thing
00:00:49.082 over and over again.
00:00:50.550 We also gave them their own
00:00:51.751 private bathroom,which comes with the shower
00:00:53.953 and obviously has no cameras insideand a bed to sleep on.
00:00:56.790 They have everythingthey need to survive 100 days.
00:00:59.092 It's just a question of dothey want it?
00:01:01.127 I got a comb. I don't know ifI've ever combed my hair in my life.
00:01:05.065 Interesting.
00:01:06.299 See how they're both standingon different sides of the room?
00:01:08.301 They're so awkward.
00:01:09.335 When I had themtake their blindfolds off.
00:01:11.071 That was legitimatelythe first time they had ever met.
00:01:15.642 I just keep thinking of the feelinglike
00:01:17.844 of exiting.
00:01:19.079 Oh, yeah?
00:01:19.612 How good is that going to feel?
00:01:25.785 It's only a 100 sleeps.
00:01:27.153 Only 100 sleeps.
00:01:28.054 And then the world will have justkept going.
00:01:31.257 That's like, what freaks me out.
00:01:33.526 The most interestingpart of this experiment is that
00:01:35.829 in this room, you have no ideawhat day or time it is.
00:01:39.632 And already night one.
00:01:40.967 Suzie and Bailey made the mistakeof only sleeping for 2 hours,
00:01:45.572 which means they startedtheir second day at 2:37 a.m.
00:01:49.209 I'm just going to just act likethis is just the new normal.
00:01:52.278 Okay, what do you want to eat?- Are you feeling beef or chicken?
00:01:54.781 Chicken.- Chicken sounds great.
00:01:58.918 That is sickening.
00:02:03.556 It's good.
00:02:05.291 As you can see, living insidea white cube is pretty boring.
00:02:08.193 Besides eating the same thing
00:02:09.461 over and over, time in the chamberconsisted of two things
00:02:12.765 trying to hidefrom the bright light.
00:02:14.400 The lights are just so bright,that we have to make these things
00:02:17.937 to shield ourselves.
00:02:18.938  And desperate attempts
00:02:19.873 to keep themselves entertained.
00:02:21.274 Like on day four,when they use the paper
00:02:23.710 from their journalsto make a deck of playing cards.
00:02:26.679 Is he making... Cards?
00:02:28.214 All right.So I just finished my deck of cards.
00:02:29.682 I think that they actually came out all right.
00:02:31.151 Which honestly looked pretty fun.
00:02:32.752 So I made myself a $30,000 seatand joined it.
00:02:40.793 On day five,they made a sign in sheet,
00:02:42.629 which was really justan elaborate trick.
00:02:44.764 What is it?
00:02:45.298 You have to sign our sign in sheet.
00:02:47.233 Oh, these are our camera people.
00:02:48.401 Yeah, this is everyone that's come in today.
00:02:50.303 Wait a minute.
00:02:51.337 You're having them do this
00:02:52.338 so you can track the dateand the time.
00:02:55.108 Hold up, I need to borrow this.
00:02:56.643 No, no, I wrote the date.
00:02:58.011 I wrote the date.
00:02:58.811 Which I got to say was pretty smart.
00:03:00.580 But by the time we got to day seven,
00:03:02.348 anything consideredsmart was thrown out the window.
00:03:05.385 Bailey's lost it.
00:03:07.854 He's whipping the pork.
00:03:11.391 Yeah.
00:03:12.158 The veggies never stood a chance.
00:03:14.861 Five more throws.
00:03:16.963 But I only need one.
00:03:18.631 Let's freakin go, baby.
00:03:20.133 It's actually crazy to methat already on day 9
00:03:22.635 of this challenge, they'rebored enough to expose the red line
00:03:26.539 that if they cross, they loseevery dollar of their prize money.
00:03:31.110 It is now day number ten.
00:03:32.579 How you doing, Nolan?
00:03:33.546 Good.
00:03:34.514 And I got a prettyinteresting offer.
00:03:36.049 What is it?
00:03:39.586 So it looks like they tookthe $500,000 and put 250 on her side
00:03:43.456 and 250 on his to remind themselvesof what's at stake.
00:03:47.493 The whole dooropening thing is so dramatic.
00:03:49.929 How's it going?
00:03:50.730 We're about to reveal the mostinteresting part of the challenge.
00:03:53.299 I need you two to just face this wall.
00:03:55.668 They don't even knowthat there's a door back here.
00:03:57.937 Let's do this.
00:04:04.744 This is their first time seeingthe outside world in 10 days.
00:04:07.780 You are kidding me.
00:04:11.084 The sky.
00:04:12.385 Every ten days,I will give you something
00:04:14.520 that will make the challenge easier.
00:04:15.788 But if you actually want it,
00:04:17.156 you have to pay for itwith some of your prize money.
00:04:19.358 And first, for day ten,
00:04:20.526 we're going to give youthe option to buy a private chef
00:04:22.662 that'll cook youwhatever you want between now
00:04:24.664 and the end of the challengefor $50,000.
00:04:26.733 Before you answer,
00:04:27.934 if you want to give upsome of your prize money,
00:04:29.769 we're gonna letyou have a nice meal.
00:04:30.970 Use this as a floorfor your imagination
00:04:32.972 as to what you could be eating for90 more days.
00:04:36.576 You are kidding me.
00:04:38.011 50 grand a lot, though.
00:04:39.412 Okay, let's not think about itright now.
00:04:40.647 These look like some peoplethat have only canned chicken
00:04:43.049 for ten days.
00:04:43.950 I love just looking at the sky.
00:04:46.853 You forget that they literallyhaven't seen the sun in 10 days.
00:04:50.156 Now I feel bad.
00:04:50.923 After eating this,the thought of that food
00:04:53.192 is like grossing me out even worse.
00:04:54.761 It's rough.
00:04:55.795 They're starting to talk aboutwhether they should take it.
00:04:58.231 I don't know what to do.- I don't either.
00:04:59.932 This is a good first one to tempt uswith.
00:05:02.502 Oh, no.- Hey Jimmy.
00:05:03.903 All right.It's time for the decision.
00:05:06.539 Would you pay $50,000 to have thisfor the rest of the challenge?
00:05:11.544 Nope.- I think we decided no.
00:05:13.246 Really?
00:05:13.846 I honestly didn'tthink you guys would say no.
00:05:16.149 Oh, no, no.- Oh, my God.
00:05:19.018 I have another offer in ten days.
00:05:20.687 We'll see if you cave, then.
00:05:21.921 I really thoughtyou were going to say yes.
00:05:24.090 That was crazy.- Bye.
00:05:25.758  I'm really curious aboutwhat the next temptation is.
00:05:28.161 I know,but you know what?
00:05:29.796 I'm proud of usfor staying strong.
00:05:31.230 Good job.
00:05:31.964 And now, with the chef gone,
00:05:33.466 it seemed like Suzieand Bailey were already starting
00:05:35.968 to regret their decision.
00:05:37.303 Bon appétit.
00:05:38.204 My favorite part isthat you can hold it sideways,
00:05:41.274 And it stays on the plate.
00:05:42.575 The next few days werepretty mind-numbing for the both of them.
00:05:45.311 Their routine consistedof waking up, cooking food,
00:05:48.081 and then eventuallyjust going back to sleep.
00:05:50.216 Man, the longer I'm in here,
00:05:51.918 the more I feel like I'm sharinga space with an annoying sibling.
00:05:55.722 Are you talking about me?
00:05:57.590 Who else?
00:05:58.925 And even though they were gettingused to each other, one thing
00:06:01.527 they weren't getting used to werethe constant beaming lights.
00:06:04.664 It's just so bright in there.
00:06:05.865 I came in the bathroom becausethe light, you can keep it off.
00:06:08.601 So it's nice and like dark in here.
00:06:10.303 Once it gets super late at night,I physically feel my eyes stinging
00:06:15.174 just because of how brightthe lights are in here
00:06:17.777 and because it was so hardfor them to get any sleep.
00:06:20.313 I had the perfect offerplanned for day 20.
00:06:24.984 Congrats, you're 20% done.
00:06:27.220 Are you two ready for the offer?
00:06:28.721 Yeah.- Yes.
00:06:29.989 Your day 20 offer is simple.
00:06:31.924 I will give you each a smart bedthat are super comfortable
00:06:34.627 and combined will cost$50,000 of your prize money.
00:06:37.830 I will also give you this iPad
00:06:38.931 with the abilityto turn off the lights.
00:06:41.334 Dang.
00:06:42.802 They have exactly one hourto decide if they want to spend
00:06:44.804 $50,000 of their prize moneyfor these beds
00:06:48.007 and the ability to turn off the lights.
00:06:49.342 The answer might be yes.
00:06:51.110 I haven't seen Suzie this happysince we literally started
00:06:53.913 the challenge.
00:06:54.313 Let's remember what we would haveto live with if we don't say yes.
00:06:58.351 Oh, my gosh.
00:06:59.752 Oh, my gosh.
00:07:02.221 I think they're going to take it.
00:07:03.623 I think we should.
00:07:05.391 It's only 10% of our money.
00:07:07.293 It's decisiontime.
00:07:10.296 Your 1 hour is up.
00:07:11.631 This is whatyour eyeballs could have.
00:07:13.533 But if you say no,this is what you're stuck with
00:07:16.436 for 80 days straight.
00:07:17.970 Do you want this comfortable beds?
00:07:19.238 I'm actually okay with whatever you say.
00:07:20.606 Five, four.- Oh, my gosh.
00:07:22.909 Three.- I’m happy with whatever you say.
00:07:24.277 Two, one.- Bailey, yes or no? Bailey, yes or no?
00:07:26.913 What's your decision?
00:07:30.683 No.
00:07:31.484 Really?
00:07:34.220 Ok... Wow.
00:07:36.189 I did not see that one coming.
00:07:38.791 I think I made a mistake, maybe.
00:07:41.060 Oh, what a heavy mistake.
00:07:42.395 I cannot believe you guys said no.
00:07:44.630 I'll leave you alonefor a couple of days.
00:07:46.299 I hope you don't regretyour decision.
00:07:47.934 Bye- Bye.
00:07:49.435 I think we made the right decision.
00:07:51.370 I can't believe that
00:07:52.305 in the heat of the momentyou said no.
00:07:55.107 I feel that slight regret right now.
00:07:56.843 I don't.
00:07:57.810 I feel no regret in your decision.
00:08:02.682 So today I made my calendar,and I was just writing
00:08:06.452 my mom's birthday.
00:08:07.954 It's going tobe tough on that day, I think.
00:08:15.161 I'm so bored.
00:08:17.163 I think that we're hitting a point
00:08:18.397 where boredom islike at a all-time high.
00:08:20.666 I woke up this morningand didn't feel like doing anything,
00:08:23.669 so I just sat there and stared.
00:08:27.874 What are you going to do with this money?
00:08:29.242 I have a house, I was probablygoing to pay a lot on the house.
00:08:31.611 Oh, that's awesome.
00:08:32.945 I want to pay off my parents debt.
00:08:35.381 That would be like my ideal world.
00:08:37.183 Throughout the following days,
00:08:38.251 I made sure to not interruptthe routine.
00:08:40.486 However,I was also taking note of things
00:08:42.621 they missed from the outside world,
00:08:44.290 like on day 24 when I overheard themwanting seasoning on their food.
00:08:48.127 Okay, if we add seasoning, I caneasily stay here a hundred days.
00:08:52.698 On day 27, Suzie was craving coffee.
00:08:55.034 I am a big coffeedrinker and I only have water.
00:08:59.305 And on day 28, Bailey clearly neededentertainment.
00:09:05.077 So by day 30
00:09:05.878 I had the perfect planto get them to spend money.
00:09:08.481 It's now day 30 andit's time for another offer.
00:09:10.583 How's it going?- Hi.
00:09:12.485 Today's offer is simple.
00:09:13.853 Each of these five itemscost $10,000.

00:09:19.625 your own coffee machine, spices,salt and pepper for your food.

00:09:25.097 You could buy one of them.You can buy all five of them.
00:09:27.133 This is tough, actually.You have 10 minutes to decide.
00:09:29.869 Just let me know what you want.
00:09:30.803 I'm so nervous.
00:09:31.637 This is a big decision.- Coffee?
00:09:34.173 It does sound kind of nice.- It does.
00:09:36.475 And then the seasoning.- Seasoning sounds nice too.
00:09:38.644 I'm doing this one1,000% I'll be honest with you.
00:09:41.247 I don't really care about that.
00:09:42.715 Sick.
00:09:43.249 Coffee would be nice,
00:09:44.817 as like a treat every morning.
00:09:46.419 I've made my mind up.
00:09:48.321 Decision time.

00:09:51.524 No.- No.

00:09:55.194 No.- No.
00:09:58.230 Are you buying the coffee?

00:10:17.650 This feels good.It was a pleasure doing business.
00:10:19.986 Thanks for taking your money.
00:10:21.220 Most expensive coffeemaker in the world.
00:10:23.456 30 days in, we got somethingnew, that's exciting.
00:10:25.591 We caved. You're welcome.
00:10:27.059 That's my closet.
00:10:28.260 That's my bookshelf.
00:10:29.362 I could stay another 70 days easy.
00:10:31.330 And we still have $480,000 It’s crazy.
00:10:34.233 Over the next few days.
00:10:35.501 Not a lot happened.
00:10:36.602 She's already preparing a meal.- It's like being married.
00:10:39.105 The most interesting thing waswhen
00:10:40.573 hurricane Idaliatook out the power on day 34.
00:10:43.442 Oh, no way.- No way.
00:10:45.911 As you can imagine,our cameras became pretty useless.
00:10:49.749 So I'mjust going to take you to day 39.
00:10:51.951 How's it going?
00:10:52.952 Hello?- Hi.
00:10:53.719 Hey.
00:10:54.720 I knowyou guys have been struggling.
00:10:56.522 I'm sorry it took so long.
00:10:58.891 Hold up.
00:11:00.860 Oh there we go.
00:11:01.694 That was a long delay.
00:11:03.229 You should be able to useyour coffee pot again, cook food.
00:11:05.731 You should have a hot shower.
00:11:06.966 That's excellent.
00:11:07.833 I'll see you tomorrowwith the surprise.
00:11:09.201 Oh, I'm so excited.
00:11:11.637 The power's on.
00:11:12.571 Look, it's light.
00:11:13.739 Like it feels like cheerier.
00:11:15.274 The lights are back on again.
00:11:17.143 I just had a hot meal, hot shower.
00:11:20.780 Life is finally looking up here.
00:11:23.649 There's now day 40.
00:11:25.918 Can I come in?- Come in.
00:11:27.720 Your gift at no expense is this TV.
00:11:31.023 But every single movie is $10,000a pop.
00:11:33.926 You have one hour to decide.Have fun.
00:11:36.062 This is crazy.The amount of movies in here.
00:11:38.064 We can watch this documentary about Nolan.
00:11:41.167 We left Suzie and Baileyto discuss the offer
00:11:43.302 and told them we'd be back later,but they didn't seem too interested.
00:11:46.405 How about ten grand for all?
00:11:47.707 I'll go ahead and tell you now, no.
00:11:50.276 You might as well just come in here,because I think we both are
00:11:53.913 set in our ways.
00:11:55.648 Okay.
00:11:56.315 The best I could dois buy one, get one half off.
00:12:00.453 Can't do it.
00:12:01.320 All right gang, come on in.
00:12:02.655 Take every last one.
00:12:03.989 I'll gladly keep this.
00:12:05.357 Not any of the Hunger Games?
00:12:08.194 I left the TV in the chamberto remind Suzie and Bailey
00:12:10.629 of what they could have had.
00:12:11.564 But little did I knowthey were going to outsmart me.
00:12:14.200 An antenna is just a piece of metal.
00:12:15.668 Rip this little wire off the wall.
00:12:18.471 So I had to take this knifeso that the wire is, like, frayed.
00:12:21.807 I literally just plugged itinto the antenna spot.
00:12:24.410 Now we're going to see if it works.
00:12:25.978 Just anything.
00:12:26.912 Give us one channel.
00:12:29.248 What?
00:12:29.982 It says that there's seven digitalchannels.
00:12:31.951 Oh, my gosh.
00:12:32.952 If this actually works...
00:12:36.889 Wait.
00:12:37.790 I'm like actually shaking.- Bailey!
00:12:39.358 Currently the only thingthat we can get on the TV
00:12:41.260 is a race car race.
00:12:42.394 Never really been a fan.- Oh, he's in second.
00:12:45.030 But today, all of a sudden, we'rehuge race car fans.
00:12:48.734 Our time is going to fly by.
00:12:51.203 And Suzie was rightbecause for the next six days,
00:12:53.672 that's all they did.
00:12:57.710 Having the TVfeels like we're in purgatory.
00:12:59.912 It's like almost normal life.
00:13:02.248 It is my mom's birthday tomorrow,even though I won't be able
00:13:05.151 to spend the day with her.
00:13:06.519 I got some time in here to make hera little birthday present.
00:13:10.022 Although I didn't go out and buysomething, I'm technically
00:13:13.025 spending money on it.
00:13:14.360 Tomorrow is day 50,so I'm going to use toilet paper
00:13:17.863 to do streamersand decorate the room.
00:13:23.803 It's day 50.
00:13:25.671 Oh hey!
00:13:26.972 So what do you thinkyour surprise is today?
00:13:28.841 I have no idea.
00:13:30.042 This one is a very big one.
00:13:31.844 All right, so the offer for day 50is $20,000 for you to see your family.
00:13:36.015 They're in the other room
00:13:36.982 watching that feed and they can heareverything we're saying,
00:13:39.585 Hey, I miss you guys.- Hi! I love you guys.
00:13:42.188 I'll be back in 10 minutes to hearif you're going to take the offer.
00:13:44.990 Good luck. 10 minutes.
00:13:46.158 This is like a pretty easy decision.
00:13:47.760 What are your thoughts?
00:13:48.594 Oh, my gosh.I don't know.
00:13:49.562 This might be the only chance
00:13:50.830 in this challengeto see them until the end.
00:13:52.731 I think it's ano brainer personally.
00:13:54.166 So it's up to you on
00:13:55.201 if we spend 20 grand for both.
00:13:56.902 Of course. I want to see my parents too.
00:13:58.571 It's killing me.
00:13:59.672 He is a yes and she is a no.
00:14:01.440 Mom, dad, tell me what to do.
00:14:03.576 All right.
00:14:04.343 What do you think?And where are you guys at?
00:14:05.644 He's been a yes from the beginning.
00:14:07.179 As soon as you said it.
00:14:08.480 About 10 seconds left.
00:14:10.015 But it's my mom's birthday today andwe're saying yes.
00:14:12.151 All right.Give me $20,000 and I'll go get them.
00:14:14.019 Best 10K ever spent,I think.
00:14:16.188 Okay.
00:14:16.922 They paid the 20 grand.Come on in.
00:14:19.058 I'm so excited.
00:14:26.732 It was a tough decision.
00:14:28.801 I made you a birthday gift.
00:14:30.402 And to celebrate her birthday,we brought a birthday cake.
00:14:36.508 This is the best tasty thingthey've had in forever.
00:14:39.578 It's little things like thatthat you don't realize
00:14:41.881 you won't haveuntil you're in it.
00:14:44.149 Bye! Love you.
00:14:45.117 Bye!
00:14:46.485 That's the worst feeling so far.
00:14:48.687 The highest of highs.
00:14:50.089 And now back to our little cubeall alone.
00:14:54.660 Like I said earlier,the things we're offering
00:14:56.695 them are based off of what
00:14:57.930 we're overhearing themtalk about in the cube.
00:15:00.199 So you better believe thatwhen Suzie said this.
00:15:02.301 Probably the only thing I'd say yes to atthis point is like if they do Tesla.
00:15:05.704 You already know on day 60 I knewexactly what to surprise them with.
00:15:08.941 How's it going?- Hi.
00:15:10.809 Oh, hey.
00:15:11.310 First things first.I brought you a giant mystery gift.
00:15:14.713 Do the two ofyou want to spend $50,000
00:15:18.017 to keepwhat's inside of this box?
00:15:20.786 Is either going to be
00:15:21.420 the best moment of their lifeor the worst moment.
00:15:23.756 Just give me your answer in an hour.
00:15:25.224 All right,Thanks. We'll be thinking.
00:15:26.558 59 minutes remain in.
00:15:28.327 I think we should.
00:15:29.228 I know, I think it might be worth it.
00:15:31.230 Imagine it is somethinggreat and we said no.
00:15:33.265 Would it ever be a car?
00:15:34.967 Well, it could be.Could actually be the keys to a car.
00:15:37.269 It's not going to be equalto the value that we're spending.
00:15:40.139 She's right.It's almost three times more.
00:15:41.740 I don't feel confident in the yes.
00:15:44.143 Then let's say no.
00:15:44.977 But are you sure?
00:15:45.978 Yeah, if you're not confident.
00:15:47.246 I just knowthey would never do a car.
00:15:50.149 Yeah, they would.- Really?
00:15:51.283 Yeah I feel like they could do anything.Let's just say no.
00:15:53.452 Wait, now you have mewanting to say yes.
00:15:57.056 Decision time.
00:15:58.123 Okay.
00:15:58.757 Do you want to spend $50,000to keep what is inside this box?
00:16:03.195 Yes or no?
00:16:04.596 No.
00:16:05.397 Really?
00:16:06.632 What is your answer?
00:16:07.766 I'm going with no.
00:16:09.034 Really?- Yeah.
00:16:09.935 I can't believe you guysdidn't take it.
00:16:11.971 Do you want to unlock it?- Sure.
00:16:15.341 All right, inside is $50,000, so youwould have got your money back.
00:16:20.479 And then you want to open upthat stack of money. Just grab that.
00:16:23.015 Here is a Tesla key for youand a Tesla key for you.
00:16:27.953 I'm so sorry.
00:16:29.822 They would have gotten their moneyback.
00:16:31.290 Plus these two Teslas for free.
00:16:33.559 Oh, I want to cry.
00:16:34.860 Let's close this.
00:16:37.730 That's literally my dream.
00:16:39.264 We're going to head out.
00:16:40.132 You leave their Beef. Thank you.
00:16:41.967  Bye.
00:16:43.469 I feel defeated.- That's wild.
00:16:45.704 Bailey...
00:16:47.239 They got us Teslas.
00:16:49.608 I feel like we made the wrongdecision.
00:16:51.477 I'll regret this forever.
00:16:53.012 No.- Yeah, I will.
00:16:55.314 Oh, no, it's all a dream.
00:16:58.283 I like my Prius.Okay?
00:17:00.019 There, I said it.
00:17:02.821 And after getting hit hardby yesterday's offer, Suzie literally
00:17:06.025 whined about the Tesla for nine daysstraight.
00:17:08.926 It's really hard to see the positivein all this.
00:17:11.130 I actually won't be able to sleep.
00:17:13.098 I'm actually feeling sick right now.
00:17:16.702 I'm so mad.
00:17:19.137 Suzie's taking it hard.
00:17:20.539 And so to make up for it,
00:17:21.473 I made sure this next offerwas the best one yet.
00:17:25.109 It's day 70.
00:17:26.578 Today's a big daybecause this is the last offer.
00:17:29.248 So obviously on day 80,there's only 20 days left
00:17:31.917 and on day 90 you're going to be like,why would we spend money?
00:17:34.286 There's ten days left, correct?- Yeah.
00:17:35.754 Let me just open the doors.- Oh God
00:17:37.089 No shot you reject this offer.
00:17:38.624 What you see here is everythingyou said no to so far in this challenge.
00:17:43.328 Before I tell you the price tag, I'mgoing to move everything in here.
00:17:45.597 I'm gonna make it as easyas possible for them to say yes.
00:17:47.633 Nolan, just put those by the TV.
00:17:50.736 As much as I love tobully Nolan, he's just dumb.
00:17:55.507 Here's a bed.
00:17:56.275 If you guys say no,we have to move
00:17:57.910 all of this back out.
00:17:59.244 Well,then give us a good price.
00:18:00.813 What you are considering buyingis these two $30,000 beds.
00:18:04.583 A brand new mystery box.
00:18:06.151 This one doesn't have 50grand inside.
00:18:07.753 It has something else.
00:18:09.922 Sounds like 25 grand.
00:18:11.156 One phone called each, spices,monopoly, every single movie
00:18:15.594 in the Walmart movie aisle.
00:18:16.795 And lastly,the cook you said no to.
00:18:19.898 There is a plate of food.- I see a lot of good food.
00:18:22.568 And to remind you how good it is,
00:18:24.269 here's some chicken alfredo.
00:18:25.871 That looks so good.
00:18:27.005 It's time to find outhow much this will cost you.
00:18:29.741 Behind these curtains is the number.
00:18:31.610 If you bid higher than that number,you get everything here
00:18:34.580 for the rest of the challenge.
00:18:35.514 But if you say $1, one penny lower,you get nothing.
00:18:39.751 I'll give you an hourto figure out your bid.
00:18:41.353 I'm thinking,
00:18:41.887 what if it's like, way lowand they want us to say 150 grand?
00:18:45.724 I think if we've been 75,that would be too little.
00:18:49.361 They're thinking at least 100 K.
00:18:51.263 I actually feel likewe should go a little bit lower
00:18:53.198 because we were prepared to say noto it.
00:18:54.733 That's true.
00:18:55.300 But are you preparedto walk away with nothing?
00:18:57.369 And while they're decidingwhat to do,
00:18:58.937 I want to tell you about the Shop app.
00:19:00.439 The Shop app is the best wayto shop on your phone
00:19:03.242 and it's completely free.
00:19:04.543 It'll basically look at everythingyou're interested in
00:19:06.645 and recommend you products you love.
00:19:08.347 This is the only wild card
00:19:09.481 because we know what beds areand we know what movies are.
00:19:11.717 We don't know what's in here.
00:19:12.784 I have a feeling I wantwhatever is inside.
00:19:15.187 It's actually a third contestant.
00:19:17.756 Help!
00:19:18.323 And when you're ready to buy,you can speed through
00:19:20.325 check out using Shop Pay.
00:19:22.027 Let's do this 80 grand 101,because it's day 70.
00:19:25.130 I don't want to go under 70.
00:19:26.265 I feel like this gives us space.
00:19:27.699 I get what you're saying.
00:19:29.067 But imagine that was the reason whywe didn't end up getting all this.
00:19:32.971 Yeah.- I would be so sad.
00:19:37.476 Shop app will even trackall your packages in one place
00:19:40.479 so you'll know exactlywhen they'll arrive for the holidays.
00:19:42.581 A $100,000 and $100.
00:19:45.017 Yeah. It's not reallythat much damage.
00:19:46.952 This is it, this is the one.- Ready? Official
00:19:49.321 We're flipping it.
00:19:51.356 I hope we get it.
00:19:52.057 Let the Shop app AI assistant scan
00:19:54.092 hundreds of millions of productsall over the Shop app
00:19:56.261 to recommend these perfect giftsfor this holiday season.
00:19:58.830 Time is up. What's the number?
00:20:01.500 Let me see it.
00:20:02.100 Before you do, make sure youdownload the Shop app right now.
00:20:04.903 If you haven't already, I explained
00:20:05.938 all the benefits of it, it'sa beautiful amazing app.
00:20:07.606  Download the Shop app. Okay.
00:20:09.041 What is your bid?
00:20:09.741 If it's $1 below mine,you get nothing.
00:20:12.844 $100,101.
00:20:14.546 Chandler reveal it.
00:20:19.484 69.
00:20:20.519 We get it! Yes!
00:20:22.854 You overpaid by 30.- I don't care.
00:20:24.990 We get the bed!
00:20:27.059 This is the most excited I've been so far.
00:20:28.527 Oh my Gosh!
00:20:29.494 And this mystery box,which I did clarify, was different.
00:20:32.831 It's two smaller Teslas.
00:20:35.567 No, I love this.
00:20:36.969 I'll be teaming up with the Shop app
00:20:38.203 to grant thousands of wishesthis holiday season.
00:20:40.839 I'll tell you more about itat the end of the video.
00:20:42.541 Our room feels drastically differentright now.
00:20:45.410 It's a dream.- We now have so many things to do.
00:20:48.180 It's like a vacation.
00:20:49.181 It's an investment for sure.
00:20:50.649 I think it was well worth $100,000.
00:20:52.818 You may think, Oh,the challenge is over now,
00:20:54.453 but one of them may lose everythingyou'll see on day 99
00:20:57.322 what I'm talking about.
00:20:58.690 Oh my God, this is crazy.
00:21:00.125 Now, you would think that gettingall this stuff
00:21:02.027 would make both of thema lot happier, but strangely enough,
00:21:05.364 the opposite actually startedto happen.
00:21:10.469 One thing I took for granted onthe outside
00:21:12.504 was a hot shower that I also didnot share with anyone.
00:21:16.041 The hot water tank hereruns out so quickly and
00:21:19.544 Bailey always showers before me,
00:21:21.113 so I've been stuckshowering with cold water
00:21:23.482 for honestly a couple of months now.
00:21:25.384 We've been playingthe same Monopoly game
00:21:26.985 for like seven daysbecause Suzie refuses to play
00:21:30.756 like I maybe she justhates board games.
00:21:32.157 I think we need to take like three daysand cram as many movies as we can.
00:21:36.028 All she ever does is reador watch movies.
00:21:38.030 We got to have like a moviemarathon.
00:21:39.865 So whenever I'm like,Can we just finish the game?
00:21:41.700 She's like, Yeah.
00:21:42.534 And then it never ends up happening.
00:21:43.802 It's impossible to get her to focus.
00:21:47.572 Hey, do you want to watchThe Notebook later?
00:21:49.741 No, I don't want to watchThe Notebook later.
00:21:51.276 We spent the last like 25 minutestrying to choose a movie.
00:21:54.379 And Suzie,what did you say you're about to go do?
00:21:56.114 Shower.
00:21:57.783 Sorry.
00:21:58.617 She literallydoes this all the time.
00:22:02.854 Bailey is wired right now.
00:22:04.489 This happensliterally every morning.
00:22:06.224 He's just nonstop, so energeticall the time.
00:22:09.161 I just had to come in herebecause I can't go anywhere else.
00:22:11.897 That's a rave right there.
00:22:13.231 Bailey, it's 3 a.m.
00:22:14.900 Yeah,but sometimes you got to rave.
00:22:17.769 Oh, get me out of here.
00:22:20.972 You're the worst.
00:22:24.910 Do you want to play Monopoly?
00:22:28.046 No.
00:22:29.147 Do you know where the dice are?
00:22:30.449 Yeah,
00:22:32.517 I hid thembecause you keep asking me to play.
00:22:35.320 So I was like,maybe if I just hide them,
00:22:36.621 then we'll never be able to play.
00:22:45.163 Your toes look so long.
00:22:47.065 No, that's sickening.
00:22:48.800 My dogs are barking.
00:22:52.471 I would like to be saved.
00:22:56.041 Mom, I'm ready to leave.
00:22:57.676 Even though at this pointthey could hardly stand each other.
00:23:00.178 With the end so close,they set their differences aside
00:23:02.881 and counted down the days.
00:23:04.149 Four days left, three.
00:23:05.617 And Bailey, well...
00:23:06.752  It's going to be
00:23:09.421 Really couldn't waitto walk out those doors.
00:23:13.325 I wasn't in the middleof saying anything.
00:23:15.293 All right.
00:23:16.161 Day 99.
00:23:18.196 For me, it feels like it's beenhonestly an entire year.
00:23:20.899 I can't imaginewhat they're feeling.
00:23:22.367 I have to brush my teethone more time.
00:23:24.169 Ever
00:23:26.171 24 hours remain.
00:23:28.240 This many.- Yes.
00:23:30.175 So this is the first second ofthe challenge when you've both walked in.
00:23:33.812 Oh, my Gosh.- How was that us?
00:23:37.082 I feel like I looklike I'm a fetus in that.
00:23:39.885 Come on in, gentleman.
00:23:41.052 Set it up right above the door.
00:23:42.721 It's so exciting.
00:23:44.022 You officially have 24 hoursleft in the challenge.
00:23:47.492 Don't forget what I said.
00:23:48.960 We got a fun twist for tomorrow.
00:23:51.296 I'm scared.
00:23:51.930 You think they'll still be friendsafter this?
00:23:53.398 Dependswhat their answer is tomorrow.
00:23:55.367 I'm worried that it'sgoing to be double or nothing.
00:23:58.203 He's so, like, quiet about it.
00:23:59.271 You can't guess.- Yeah.
00:24:00.372 And with their final nightcoming to an end,
00:24:02.274 It was time to present them with anopportunity to double their money.
00:24:06.845 Hey, everyone.
00:24:08.647 This is chaotic.
00:24:09.648 What is going on?
00:24:10.916 I don't know.
00:24:12.517 Big boy.
00:24:13.652 I want to help, but not really.
00:24:14.719 They're literally just taking everything.
00:24:18.390 Do you know what these are?
00:24:19.291 Those are blindfoldsfrom the first day.
00:24:20.892 That was quick.
00:24:21.626 I remember it like it was yesterday.
00:24:22.727 If you would bothplease put them back on.
00:24:24.930 Let's seeif they want to double their money.
00:24:26.865 Okay.
00:24:28.667 Oh my gosh, my heart is actuallybeating out of my chest.
00:24:32.070 100 days ago, they were strangers.
00:24:33.672 One hour ago they were best friends.
00:24:35.340 Let'ssee if they become total enemies.
00:24:37.142 Bailey and Suzie,
00:24:38.243 take your blindfolds off.
00:24:40.745 So you might be familiarwith what we're about to offer you.
00:24:44.816 You each have the choice to splitthe money, and nothing changes.
00:24:48.887 You both hit split.You just split it.
00:24:50.489 Keep what you have,
00:24:51.656 or if you hit steal, you can stealthe other person's money.
00:24:55.494 And if you both hitsteal, you would get nothing.
00:24:58.797 Suzie has earplugs in
00:25:00.565 and noise cancellationheadphones on top of them.
00:25:02.767 She can't hear us.What's going through your head?
00:25:05.003 I don't even know, Suzieif you put steal, I can't imagine.
00:25:11.009 What do you say to somebodythat steals 180? Whatever.
00:25:13.411 Maybe you get ahead of itand you steal it.
00:25:15.647 Fair.
00:25:16.281 Do you hear that?
00:25:17.449 Bailey actually might.Bailey might.
00:25:19.217 All right.throw the music back in his ears.
00:25:21.953 What if while we were over there,he was like,
00:25:23.555 "Oh, this is a no brainer.It's too much money"
00:25:25.257 We would never speak again.
00:25:26.291 You guys have become, like,such close friends.
00:25:28.226 I don't know.You get to know anyone.
00:25:29.761 And when you've gonethrough the same thing
00:25:32.397 and like how hard this challenge hasbeen, we both deserve half for sure.
00:25:36.568 But now you're making me nervous.
00:25:38.637 Like I could do it, too.
00:25:41.172 What did she just say?
00:25:42.240 Maybe it'll be a case of youthinking of someone.
00:25:44.509 I don't know.
00:25:45.210 If both of them press the steal button,
00:25:46.678 they literally spend 100 daysin this room together
00:25:49.080 for absolutely nothing.
00:25:50.148 There's 30 seconds left in thechallenge at the very last second.
00:25:53.685 I want you both to place your vote.
00:25:55.754 Do you want to walk awaywith 360 grand or half of it?
00:25:59.324 No one speak.
00:26:00.058 Karl and Kris,you two don't talk either.
00:26:01.893 I know that Suzie is going to split,but the thought of walking away
00:26:05.163 with almost $360,000,I could do so much.
00:26:09.634 Do you want to split the moneyor steal it?
00:26:11.570 The fact that I entered thischallenge,
00:26:13.238 Three.
00:26:13.939 Knowing that
00:26:15.240 there would be pretty darktimes ahead
00:26:17.375 Two.
00:26:18.143 And I still overcame all those things
00:26:20.378 One.
00:26:21.146 There's no price you can put on that.
00:26:24.916 No way.
00:26:25.917 If the room turns red,then someone stole.
00:26:28.887 If the room turns green,then you split the money.
00:26:32.791 You both chose split!
00:26:34.159 Yes!
00:26:35.894 Yes!
00:26:37.028 Congratulations on surviving!
